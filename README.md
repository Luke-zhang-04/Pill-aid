# Pill-aid

SE-101 Project

## Project Summary

Our idea is to create a pill dispenser that simplifies routine medicine-taking. Using our complimentary interface, the user can input the types of medicine they need to take, the dosage, and the time(s) at which they need to take them. Then, at the specified time(s), the dispenser will notify the user using an alarm. After confirming the userâ€™s identity through facial recognition, it will release all of the pills as needed.
